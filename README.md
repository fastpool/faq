# Fast pool FAQ

### What is a Stacking pool? How does Fast pool work?
The main processes are described in this blog post:
[https://blog.friedger.de/posts/O3JQEdDTuG5tktirZyBU2](https://blog.friedger.de/posts/O3JQEdDTuG5tktirZyBU2).

### When is the deadline to join Fast pool? When are rewards distributed?
The most important deadlines are explained on [https://fastpool.org/when](https://fastpool.org/when).

### I didn't receive my rewards. Why?
First, check whether your address is listed in the list of pool members at [https://fastpool.org/cycles/89](https://fastpool.org/cycles/89) (or the corresponding page for other cycles).

If you have changed the stx reward receiver address, check that address for your rewards.

### Can I receive rewards in BTC instead of STX?
As we used to offer a choice to receive rewards in xBTC or STX, the distribution process exists.
However, we need a verifiable process to exchange the btc address that should receive that rewards.
We can do that off-chain with signed messages and add the btc address-stx address pair manually to the list of btc receivers.

### What is liquid stacking? How does Lisa relate to Fast pool?
When stacking with a liquid stacking provider like Lisa or Stacking Dao, your STX are transferred to and are managed by the liquid stacking provider contract. In exchange you receive replacement tokens (liSTX, stSTX) that can be used on other platforms.

Lisa uses Fast pool (as well as Xverse) to stack the transferred STX and earn rewards in BTC. The BTC rewards are swapped to STX and added to the treasury. Thereby, the value of the replacement tokens increases.
